About
-----
rpc_pdb is a wrapper around the Python pdb debugger which
makes it suitable for use in RPC contexts.

It is designed to fulfil the need to debug a function on
an already-running server which uses threads or processes
to dispatch each remote procedure call, without having to
change the source code to the server in any way. There is
no disruption to other clients and rpc calls while the
selected call is being debugged.
